Fall is typically a time for muted colors that invoke ocher and earth; a time for tried-and-true insulating fabrics like corduroy and wool. There's usually a modesty about fall. This year, however, is a little different. Mood can play a role in fashion. Fashion can even acknowledge the forces of depression -- both in terms of psychology, and repetitive fashion traditions of somberness in colder seasons -- and overthrow them. Now is a time for [shiny bling jewelry][0] and Grandma [loafers][1]worn with abandon.

## Antidepress When You Dress

Sometimes when you're depressed, you take on an unorthodox style move in an act of defiance. This is the [look of the season][2]: a season for acknowledging and embracing moodiness, and then running with it.

Sequins to make your day more sparkly, [faux fur][3] that makes you feel warm and fuzzy, [animal print][4] to denote a wild side, and jeans of [any cut][5] are all back in style -- and these things can even be worn all together. Pointy shoes can be worn with anything, and [fringe][6] is everywhere. There's no particular [skirt style][7] that is "in" this fall. Mini-skirts and full skirts are both [in style][8].

## It's About You

Embracing your emotional state and then running with it is in right now, much like how it was in the 70's, when fashion came alive. It's okay to wear colors now, just as it was all through the [1970's][9]. All textures are acceptable at the moment: anything from pleather to crochet to alligator.

Mood is part of what makes people unique. It's what makes everyone have a different day. Antidepressant fashion is about dressing for yourself in a conscious effort to make yourself feel better. This fall isn't a time to appeal to what others want -- it's time to dress for you.

## Wear Your Favorite Fashion Throwbacks

This season's looks incorporate a hodgepodge of looks from different decades. Trends reflect moodiness in that people can acknowledge what's been done before, and then incorporate that into an outfit. In New Wave fashion, people started wearing fedoras, making them their own. Those are back, as well. In punk fashion, leather jackets are a staple, invoking those worn by bikers in the 1950's to intentionally connote badassery. [Leather jackets][10] can be worn with anything this fall, even evening dresses.

This fall is a great season for fashion -- it's coming [alive again.][11] It's about emotional survival in the face of the many forces of culture that try to decide the truth for us.
